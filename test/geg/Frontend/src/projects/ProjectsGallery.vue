              <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-justify">
                The upcoming construction of USTP aims to provide 
                a state-of-the-art educational facility designed to accommodate up 
                to 800 students from kindergarten through twelfth grade. Scheduled 
                to commence in June 2024, the project will cover approximately 10 
                acres and include modern classrooms, science laboratories, a library, 
                and a multi-purpose hall. The design emphasizes environmental sustainability, 
                featuring solar panels, rainwater harvesting systems, and energy-efficient 
                lighting to minimize the school's carbon footprint and operational costs. <br><br>

                In addition to academic facilities, the project will also develop sports 
                facilities, including a football pitch, a swimming pool, and gymnasiums, 
                to promote physical education and well-being among students. The construction 
                is expected to be completed by August 2026, with local construction firms 
                involved in the development. The project is funded through a combination of 
                government grants and private donations, aiming to boost educational standards 
                and community growth in the region.
